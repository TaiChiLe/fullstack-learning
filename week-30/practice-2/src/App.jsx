            Max had always dreamed of the perfect Sunday: cozy bed, snacks
            within reach, and every streaming service at his fingertips. Today,
            that dream was finally coming true. He had stocked up on popcorn,
            candy, and enough soda to float a small boat. Wrapped in his softest
            blanket, he flicked on the TV and sank into the cushions. "This," he
            thought, "is heaven."

            Just as Max found the perfect movie, his phone buzzed. It was a
            message from his friend Lisa: "Ready for our 5K run?" Max's eyes
            widened in horror. He had completely forgotten! With a groan, he
            looked from the TV to his running shoes by the door. "Well," he
            sighed, "it seemed like heaven... while it lasted!"
