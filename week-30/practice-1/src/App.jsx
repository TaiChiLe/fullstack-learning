        Captain Saltybeard and his crew set sail on The Soggy Seagull in search
        of the Lost Sea treasure. A playful pod of dolphins stole their compass,
        leaving them lost. Relying on Saltybeard's dubious navigation, they
        stumbled into a giant inflatable sea monster from a beach party. Though
        they found no treasure, they returned with tales of being outwitted by
        dolphins and a rubber Kraken.
