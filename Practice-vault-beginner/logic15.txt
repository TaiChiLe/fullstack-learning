Constraint for the moving box
- Left:
    - Left Cant be less than 0
- Up:
    - Top cant be less than 0
- Right:
    - Moving box Width + Moving box left can't be greater Bounding box width
- Down:
    - Moving box height + moving box top can't be greater than bounding box height

- Create variables to store the next moving position for top and left
- those variables will use the current value of position
- use the same logic to set the new value for these 2 top and left variables
- use if else to check if these top and left are valid values to move the box
- if yes, set the position.top and .left to those 2 variables
- then set movingBox.style... to position as usual
