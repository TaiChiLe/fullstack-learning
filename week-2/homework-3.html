    <h1>A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer</h1>
    <div>Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineer</a> named Alex. Everyday, Alex
        embarked on a journey filled with coding adventures, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">bugs</a> to conquer, and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> to fuel the
        mind.</div>

    <div> One fine morning, Alex sat down at the computer, ready to tackle the day's tasks. <span class="large-text">But
            alas</span>! The
        code refused
        to
        compile, and the bugs seemed to multiply like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit">rabbits</a> in a
        magic hat. With a sigh, Alex dove deep
        into the code,
        armed with determination and a trusty stack overflow.</div>

    <div>As lunchtime approached, Alex emerged from the coding abyss, victorious! The bugs were squashed, and the code
        ran
        smoother than a buttered-up slide. But just as Alex reached for the celebratory pizza, an urgent email arrived:
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" class="large-text">Emergency bug</a> fix required! <span
            class="text-pink">Code meltdown</span> imminent!"
    </div>

    <div>With a <span class="text-pink text-bold">heavy heart</span> and a rumbling stomach, Alex returned to the
        battlefield. The
        hours ticked by, but so did
        the
        lines of code. With each keystroke, Alex grew stronger, wiser, and slightly more caffeinated.</div>

    <div>Finally, as the clock struck midnight, <span class="text-pink large-text">victory was declared</span>! The bug
        was
        banished, the
        code was pristine, and
        Alex
        emerged from the coding cave, triumphant once more. With weary eyes and a satisfied grin, Alex closed the
        laptop
        and
        bid farewell to another day in the life of a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineer</a>.</div>
